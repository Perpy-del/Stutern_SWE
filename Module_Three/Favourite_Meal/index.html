          <h3>About Efo Riro</h3>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Efo riro is one of Nigerian's famous dishes. It is a vegetable dish
            native to the Yoruba people. Some people say it is the Yoruba
            version of <i>edikang ikong</i> soup. The word, is derived from two
            Yoruba words, <i>efo</i> which means green leafy vegetable and
            <i>riro</i> which means to stir. The vegetables used to cook this
            soup are 'Efo shoko' or 'efo tete', which you can substitute for
            spinach. This meal can be served with steamed rice or boiled yam. It
            can also be enjoyed with amala, fufu, pounded yam or any swallow of
            choice.

          <h3>Preparing Efo Riro</h3>
          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Boil and season your meats with salt, onions and stock cubes,
              starting with the shaki first which takes longer to soften than
              the others. Use as little water as possible, topping up as you
              cook, as this soup doesn't need much water. Add the stock fish
              when the shaki starts to curl. When the shaki is almost done, add
              the other meats, except the dry fish. When all the meats and fish
              have almost softened properly, add the eja sewa.
            </li>
            <li>
              Boil your blended peppers until there is no more water inside.
            </li>
            <li>
              In another pot, heat up palm oil and fry the onions until
              translucent. Add the boiled peppers and iru. Fry until it forms a
              thick paste.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once fried, add the meats and ground crayfish. Be careful and add
              the stock in small spoonfuls. You do not want watery Efo Riro.
              Cook on low heat here for about 7 minutes or until you have a
              semi-thick stew. Taste for salt and season as you like.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the vegetables and dry fish, and stir. Cook on very low heat
              for about 3 minutes and take off the fire.
            </li>
            <li>Serve hot with any swallow of your choice or rice.</li>
            <span>Enjoy!</span>
