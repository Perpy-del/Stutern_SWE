# CSS Triplicate Styling

## Using what you have learnt and understood so far on the Introduction to CSS. Create a list of 5 colors (each list will appear in its shade. I.e. “red” would appear in red, and also have an image next to it representing an item in that color I.e. an image of a red car)

### Elements in building this application.

```bash
<h1> content </h1>
```
```bash
<ul> content </ul>
```
```bash
<li> content </li>
```
```bash
<span> content </span>
```
```bash
<img src=""/>
```

### 
This will be triplicated, the first will be styled using In-line CSS, the second; internal CSS, and the third; External CSS.
