        <h3>My learnings so far in Stutern</h3>
        <p>
          I have gained a better understanding of how HTML structures the
          webpage and CSS helps to give it styling. Now I understand how most
          pages are structured and what makes them look the way they do.
        </p>
        <h4>Importance of CSS</h4>
        <p>
          CSS is what makes the webpage a lot more presentable especially with
          the introduction of semantics for HTML5 and CSS3 for better alignment and display. CSS is important for
          a number of reasons. Some of them are listed below:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>It provides more formatiing options</li>
          <li>It provides consistent design throughout your website</li>
          <li>It can better adjust your page layouts.</li>
          <li>It increases Site Performance</li>
          <li>It allows for rapid customization</li>
          <li>It lets you create animation and effects</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The differences between paddings, borders and margins</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            <span>Paddings: </span>Paddings are spaces you create around the
            element before the border of the element. This is the space
            <span id="emph">between the element and the border.</span> It can be written
            as <code>padding: 20px;</code> meaning top, bottom, left and right
            padding around the element will be 20px. We could also use
            <code>padding: 10px 20px;</code> to indicate that top and bottom
            padding will be 10px and left and right padding will be 20px.
            Another way to write it to specifiy the top, left and right and
            bottom is to use <code>padding: 10px 20px 5px;</code> to indicate
            that top will be 10px, left and right will be 20px and bottom will
            be 5px. Specifying the four dimensions you can use
            <code>padding: 20px 15px 10px 8px;</code> indicating that top should
            have a size of 20px, right should have a size of 15px, bottom should
            have a size of 10px and left should have a size of 8px. 
            <p> 
                Note that you can also specify only a dimension of the element such as padding right, padding top, padding bottom and padding left. For example: <code>padding left: 20px;</code> which indicates that the left side should have a padding of 20px. 
            </p>

          </p>

          <p>
            <span>Border: </span>This creates a border <span id="emph">between the padding and the margin of an element.</span> It has different CSS properties such as size, radius, style and color. It can be written as <code>border: 1px solid black; </code> to specify the border size as 1px, the border style as solid and the border color as black. To read more about CSS border properties. See <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp"> CSS Borders. </a>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span>Margin: </span>This is the space you create <span id="emph">outside any defined border of an element.</span> For example to give an element a margin of 50px, it can be written
            as <code>margin: 50px;</code> meaning top, bottom, left and right
            padding around the border of an element will be 50px. We could also use
            <code>margin: 10px 20px;</code> to indicate that top and bottom
            margin will be 10px and left and right margin will be 20px.
            Another way to write it to specifiy the top, left and right and
            bottom is to use <code>margin: 10px 20px 5px;</code> to indicate
            that top will be 10px, left and right will be 20px and bottom will
            be 5px. Specifying the four dimensions you can use
            <code>margin: 20px 15px 10px 8px;</code> indicating that top should
            have a size of 20px, right should have a size of 15px, bottom should
            have a size of 10px and left should have a size of 8px. 
            <p>
                Note that you can also specify only a dimension of the element such as margin right, margin top, margin bottom and margin left. For example: <code>margin left: 20px;</code> which indicates that the left side should have a padding of 20px.
